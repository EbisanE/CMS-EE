### Analyzing and Selecting the Appropriate Deployment Resource

To determine the best option for deploying the CMS app, I evaluated Azure Virtual Machines and Azure App Service across cost, scalability, availability, and workflow integration.

#### Cost
App Service is more affordable for small applications. It follows a consumption-based pricing model and includes features like SSL and scaling without additional infrastructure costs. Virtual Machines incur continuous costs and require separate resources for patching, storage, and monitoring.

#### Scalability
App Service supports easy horizontal and vertical scaling with minimal configuration. Scaling with Virtual Machines involves manual setup of load balancers and scaling sets, which adds operational complexity.

#### Availability
App Service offers high availability by default, handling patching and load balancing automatically. With a Virtual Machine, availability requires additional configuration and ongoing maintenance.

#### Workflow Integration
App Service integrates smoothly with GitHub for continuous deployment, making it ideal for projects with frequent updates. In contrast, deploying to a Virtual Machine would require manual CI/CD setup and greater maintenance effort.

### Chosen Solution: Azure App Service

Given the current needs of the CMS app, Azure App Service is the most suitable choice. It simplifies deployment, supports automated workflows, and reduces maintenance overhead. It is well suited for applications with moderate traffic, frequent updates, and limited infrastructure requirements.

### When a Virtual Machine Might Be Preferable

A Virtual Machine may be more appropriate if the app later requires a custom OS, handles heavy compute workloads, runs background processes, or needs advanced networking and security configurations. Unless these needs arise, App Service remains the better fit for this project.
